""" Mercy is in maze. The command center sent her a string which decodes to come out from the maze. She is initially at (0, 0). 
String contains L, R, U, D denoting left, right, up and down. 
In each command she will traverse 1 unit distance in the respective direction.

For example if she is at (2, 0) and the command is L she will go to (1, 0).

Input:
Input contains a single string.
Output:
Print the final point where he came out."""
